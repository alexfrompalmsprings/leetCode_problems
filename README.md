# leetCode_problems

This is a repo to keep track of my leetCodeProblems. The goal is to have 100 problems completed by April 20.

You might be wondering about the 100, right ? Well ...during college I came out with something similar.

100 IB internship applications or 'NoCoachella' for Alex.


So that's the goal!! ðŸŽ¡

87 problems to go....
